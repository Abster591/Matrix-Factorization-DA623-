# Matrix decompositions, types, and demonstration of their practical usefulness

This repository contains the submission for DA623 Computing with signals assignment. 'matrix.ipynb' is the main notebook which includes the prepared content on the selected topic. The input folder contains an image (which is used for analysis in the notebook)

## Overview
The notebook contains an introduction, implementation and discussion of application of three important matrix factorization methods namely
1. LU Decomposition
2. Eigen Decomposition
3. Singular Value Decomposition


## Installation

All the dependencies required by the notebook are listed in requirements.txt. Install the dependencies using

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
